Recipe: Beef & Tomato Soup

It's an altered family recipe, with cream and coconut milk added. It turns out better than the original one! Although we barely use cream to cook in China, my Chinese friends say it still taste like real Chinese foods!

Ingredients:
‌Beef (hanger, rib eye or shoulder)
‌Tomato
‌Potato
‌Ginger
‌Green onion (one)
‌Salt
‌Soy sauce (one spoon)
‌Black Pepper (appropriate amount!)
‌Cream (several spoons)
‌Star anise (only one star per pot because of its strong taste) (optional)
‌Sichuan Pepper (appropriate amount)(optional)
‌Coconut milk (several spoons) (optional)

Step 1: pre process the beef
Cut the beef to small cubics of about half inch.
Boil the water, then put the beef in. Wait for the water to boil again. Take away the foam,  dump away the water and keep the beef.

Step 2: soften the beef!
Put the beef in the pot, add some water until the top of the beef is about 1 inch below the water surface. Also put several slices of ginger, a star anise, several beads of Sichuan pepper and some salt. Use high heat at first, when it is boiling, turn to low heat to keep it boiling for at least 30min. You may try it to make sure the beef is soft enough.

Step 3: put in everything
Cut the green onion (don't cut it too small, about 1 inch is enough), potatoes and tomatoes while you cook the beef. Put them all in when the beef is soft, also pure in a spoon of soy sauce. Cook for about 10min with mid heat till the potato is soft. About 5min before you finish, you can add some black pepper, the cream and coconut milk goes in at this time, too.

Step 4: Enjoy!
